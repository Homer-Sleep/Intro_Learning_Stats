# Classification Chapter 4 (pg 127)

For use when the response variable is qualitative. linear regression does not work. Example, three categories of outcome (stroke, drug overdose, epileptic seizure) and linear regression assumes there is a progression or 'order' with equal difference in the outcomes. In reality, there is no order and the differences are not equal (unknown, just a different category). 


Use the Default data set.   

```{r}
Default = Default
plot(Default$balance, Default$income, pch = c("+", "*"), col = c('blue', 'red'))
```
